The Supportconfig Analysis (SCA) Appliance analyzes supportconfig archives for known issues and creates a report linking to the known solutions. The appliance stores analysis results in a MariaDB database and uses PHP to read the database and generate the report. It also has an anonymous FTP server configured to easily upload supportconfig archives for processing. 

The supportconfig tool comes with SUSE Linux Enterprise. Consequently, the SCA Appliance only supports analyzing supportconfigs from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Desktop.
